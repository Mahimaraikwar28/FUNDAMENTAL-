### TOPIC: Java Classes in java.
      Java is an object-oriented programming language.
      Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, 
      along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. 
      The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.
      A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
 ### CREATING A CLASS:     
    To create a class, use the keyword class:
      Create a class named "Main" with a variable x:

  ### SYNTANX:
                    //creating a class named "Main"
             public class Main { 
                        //initializing the attribute inside Main class.
                       int x = 5;
                    }
